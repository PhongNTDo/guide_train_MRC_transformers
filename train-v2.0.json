They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyonc\u00e9 later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyonc\u00e9's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyonc\u00e9's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups.

Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \"Halo\"'s success in the US helped Beyonc\u00e9 attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s.

Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833, in which Chopin, Liszt and Hiller performed (on pianos) a concerto by J.S. Bach for three keyboards; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil Adolphe Gutmann, Charles-Valentin Alkan, and Alkan's teacher Joseph Zimmermann performed Alkan's arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from Beethoven's 7th symphony. Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt's Hexameron; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on Bellini's theme.

They spent what Mendelssohn described as \"a very agreeable day\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn. In 1835 Chopin went to Carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzi\u0144skis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter Maria in Poland five years earlier, when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig. The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses. In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck and Felix Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio St. Paul, and who considered him \"a perfect musician\". In July 1836 Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodzi\u0144ski family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzi\u0144ska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his G minor Ballade. At the end of 1836 he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1.

Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 \u00c9tudes, and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller, \"I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies.\" However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as \"my friend Liszt\". Some commentators point to events in the two men's romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d'Agoult's obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt's growing relationship with George Sand."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who was the host of the gathering where Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric was introduced to George Sand?", "id": "56cc06496d243a140015ee5a", "answers": [{"text": "Marie d'Agoult", "answer_start": 30}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric label the place in which he placed Maria and her mother's letters about the unlikely marriage?", "id": "56cc06496d243a140015ee5d", "answers": [{"text": "My tragedy", "answer_start": 713}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did George Sand write to when admitting having a strong affection for Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric?", "id": "56cc06496d243a140015ee5e", "answers": [{"text": "Grzyma\u0142a", "answer_start": 747}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the name of the author Chopin met at a gathering put on by Marie d'Agoult?", "id": "56cfdc7f234ae51400d9bf8b", "answers": [{"text": "George Sand", "answer_start": 75}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was a possible reason for Chopin's failed engagement to Maria Wodzi\u0144ska?", "id": "56cfdc7f234ae51400d9bf8e", "answers": [{"text": "his poor health", "answer_start": 503}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Chopin write on the box of letters from Maria and her mother?", "id": "56cfdc7f234ae51400d9bf8f", "answers": [{"text": "My tragedy", "answer_start": 713}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who hosted the party whre Chopin met George Sand?", "id": "56d3234159d6e41400146288", "answers": [{"text": "Marie d'Agoult", "answer_start": 30}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What year did Maria Wodzi\u0144ska's mother tell Chopin that he likely would not marry her daughter?", "id": "56d3234159d6e41400146289", "answers": [{"text": "1837", "answer_start": 327}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Chopin write on the package that contained letters from Maria and her mother?", "id": "56d3234159d6e4140014628b", "answers": [{"text": "My tragedy", "answer_start": 713}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did Sand confide to in a letter about her feelings for Chopin in June, 1838?", "id": "56d3234159d6e4140014628c", "answers": [{"text": "Grzyma\u0142a", "answer_start": 747}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "In 1836, at a party hosted by Marie d'Agoult, Chopin met the French author George Sand (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin).

Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously bought horses in the Kham region while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing.

Digital cameras, camcorders and organizers had well-established mainstream markets, but the company found existing digital music players \"big and clunky or small and useless\" with user interfaces that were \"unbelievably awful,\" so Apple decided to develop its own. As ordered by CEO Steve Jobs, Apple's hardware engineering chief Jon Rubinstein assembled a team of engineers to design the iPod line, including hardware engineers Tony Fadell and Michael Dhuey, and design engineer Sir Jonathan Ive. Rubinstein had already discovered the Toshiba disk drive when meeting with an Apple supplier in Japan, and purchased the rights to it for Apple, and had also already worked out how the screen, battery, and other key elements would work. The aesthetic was inspired by the 1958 Braun T3 transistor radio designed by Dieter Rams, while the wheel based user interface was prompted by Bang & Olufsen's BeoCom 6000 telephone. The product (\"the Walkman of the twenty-first century\" ) was developed in less than one year and unveiled on October 23, 2001.

Despite these complaints, Computer and Video Games felt the game's atmosphere was superior to that of any previous Zelda game, and regarded Twilight Princess's Hyrule as the best version ever created.

The C-X75 was originally developed as a hybrid electric vehicle with four independent electric engines powered by two jet turbines, before the project was cancelled. The version used for filming was converted to use a conventional internal combustion engine, to minimise the potential for disruption from mechanical problems with the complex hybrid system. The C-X75s used for filming were developed by the engineering division of Formula One racing team Williams, who built the original C-X75 prototype for Jaguar."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Where did Spectre filming take place after Rome?", "id": "56cdf49362d2951400fa69c0", "answers": [{"text": "Mexico City", "answer_start": 52}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which celebration was featured in the Mexico City part of the production?", "id": "56cdf49362d2951400fa69c1", "answers": [{"text": "Day of the Dead", "answer_start": 143}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which areas were shown in the Day of the Dead scene in Spectre?", "id": "56cdf49362d2951400fa69c2", "answers": [{"text": "the Z\u00f3calo and the Centro Hist\u00f3rico district", "answer_start": 189}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many additional actors were needed for the shoot in Mexico City?", "id": "56cdf49362d2951400fa69c3", "answers": [{"text": "1,500", "answer_start": 544}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where were the scenes featuring planes shot?", "id": "56cdf49362d2951400fa69c4", "answers": [{"text": "Palenque", "answer_start": 681}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What festival was included in the scenes shot in Mexico?", "id": "56cf49ebaab44d1400b88f4c", "answers": [{"text": "the Day of the Dead festival", "answer_start": 139}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of helicopter was used for the flight scenes?", "id": "56cf49ebaab44d1400b88f4f", "answers": [{"text": "a Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm Bo 105 helicopter", "answer_start": 340}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where in Mexico were the Day of the Dead scenes shot?", "id": "56cf49ebaab44d1400b88f50", "answers": [{"text": "Z\u00f3calo and the Centro Hist\u00f3rico district", "answer_start": 193}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Mexico", "answer_start": 52}], "question": "Filming moved to which city in late May?", "id": "5ad2306ed7d075001a4286c8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Mexico", "answer_start": 52}], "question": "In which city was the film's closing sequence filmed?", "id": "5ad2306ed7d075001a4286c9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "city square", "answer_start": 267}], "question": "What was closed in order to film a fight sequence using a boat?", "id": "5ad2306ed7d075001a4286ca", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "city", "answer_start": 267}], "question": "The scene in which square required about 2,500 extras?", "id": "5ad2306ed7d075001a4286cb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "With filming completed in Rome, production moved to Mexico City in late March to shoot the film's opening sequence, with scenes to include the Day of the Dead festival filmed in and around the Z\u00f3calo and the Centro Hist\u00f3rico district.

In a lukewarm review for RogerEbert.com, Matt Zoller Seitz gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, describing Spectre as inconsistent and unable to capitalise on its potential. Kenneth Turan, reviewing the film for Los Angeles Times, concluded that Spectre \"comes off as exhausted and uninspired\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times panned the film as having \"nothing surprising\" and sacrificing its originality for the sake of box office returns. Forbes' Scott Mendelson also heavily criticised the film, denouncing Spectre as \"the worst 007 movie in 30 years\". Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly viewed Spectre as \"an overreaction to our current blockbuster moment\", aspiring \"to be a serialized sequel\" and proving \"itself as a Saga\". While noting that \"[n]othing that happens in Spectre holds up to even minor logical scrutiny\", he had \"come not to bury Spectre, but to weirdly praise it. Because the final act of the movie is so strange, so willfully obtuse, that it deserves extra attention.\" In a positive review Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, describing \"The 24th movie about the British MI6 agent with a license to kill is party time for Bond fans, a fierce, funny, gorgeously produced valentine to the longest-running franchise in movies\".

After a series of letters appeared claiming Lett had been falsely accused, his sentence was commuted to life in prison. He died there of tuberculosis in 1937.

To address complex issues, however, Tavernier-Courbin notes that Lee uses parody, satire, and irony effectively by using a child's perspective. After Dill promises to marry her, then spends too much time with Jem, Scout reasons the best way to get him to pay attention to her is to beat him up, which she does several times. Scout's first day in school is a satirical treatment of education; her teacher says she must undo the damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write, and forbids Atticus from teaching her further. Lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony, however, as Jem and Scout try to understand how Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society.

Lee used the term \"Gothic\" to describe the architecture of Maycomb's courthouse and in regard to Dill's exaggeratedly morbid performances as Boo Radley. Outsiders are also an important element of Southern Gothic texts and Scout and Jem's questions about the hierarchy in the town cause scholars to compare the novel to Catcher in the Rye and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Despite challenging the town's systems, Scout reveres Atticus as an authority above all others, because he believes that following one's conscience is the highest priority, even when the result is social ostracism. However, scholars debate about the Southern Gothic classification, noting that Boo Radley is in fact human, protective, and benevolent.
